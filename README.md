# FSTS 
Official implementation of Fourier Series-based Tampering Synthesis (FSTS) from our NeurIPS 2025 paper “Toward Real-world Text Image Forgery Localization: Structured and Interpretable Data Synthesis”.

## 📦 Dataset Access
The FSTS dataset is publicly available on the following platforms: [Kaggle]() and [Hugging Face]().

## 🧩 Examples of FSTS Synthesis Process
Below are several examples showing the *automatic synthesis pipeline* of FSTS, which collects and models real-world tampering parameters to synthesize samples with the _replacement_ operation.

### Example1


### Example2


### Example3



## 🌍 Support Future FSTS Development
The FSTS dataset has been primarily developed through self-funded effort. We are now preparing **FSTS vX**, with expanded scale and richer tampering diversity. If you are interested in **supporting or collaborating**, please reach out: kimjyu@foxmail.com.
